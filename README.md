Unsupervised Machine Learning

Netflix is one of the most popular digital streaming media service providers today. Netflix provides streaming services for movies and tv shows from various countries in the world. As a digital media with many users, Netflix also has a very large amount of data.
The  dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as - cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc.



In this project, I have done


1.Exploratory Data Analysis

2.Understanding what type content is available in different countries

3.Is Netflix increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.

4.Clustering similar content by matching text-based features

The following steps are involved in the project 

Data preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis

hypothesis testing

feature selection and finding the optimal number of clusters using elbow method fitting the clustering kmean and agglomerative algorithm 

evaluation of clusters using silhouette score and The Davies-Bouldin index (DBI )

conclusion

from elbow and sillhoute score ,optimal of 26 clusters formed , K Means is best for identification than Hierarchical as the evaluation metrics also indicates the same.In kmean cluster 0 has the highest number of datapoints and evenly distributed for other cluster

Netflix has 5372 movies and 2398 TV shows, there are more movies on Netflix than TV shows.

TV-MA has the highest number of ratings for tv shows i,e adult ratings

highest number of movies released in 2017 and 2018 highest number of movies released in 2020 The number of movies on Netflix is growing significantly faster than the number of TV shows. We saw a huge increase in the number of movies and television episodes after 2015. there is a significant drop in the number of movies and television episodes produced after 2020.
